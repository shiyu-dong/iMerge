# iMerge

An iOS App to merge two video files and export it to a new file in Camera Roll. You can preview each individual file as well as the to-be merged file before the actual merge.

Special thanks to this great tutorial which allows me to write my first iOS App in one night without knowing anything about Swift or Objective-C beforehand: http://www.raywenderlich.com/category/swift
